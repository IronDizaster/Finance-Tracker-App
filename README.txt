GUIDE:
--------------------------------------
1.0) Setting the monthly budget
--------------------------------------
You can set & adjust your monthly budget at any time during the month.
If you create or adjust your budget partway through the month, set it to the amount you plan to spend for the rest of the month, not the full monthly amount.
This is because your daily allowance is calculated as: budget ÷ (days remaining in the month)

At the start of each month, your budget resets. You’ll receive a notification showing how much you spent and saved in the previous month.

1.1) Daily Allowance Behavior
If your Daily Allowance Balance is 0 when setting the budget, the app will ask if you’d like to add +1 Daily Allowance (the amount of money you receive per day) into your Daily Allowance Balance.
This ensures you don’t have to wait for a new day to start using your budget after setting it up.

On the LAST DAY of the month, if your Daily Allowance Balance is still 0 when setting the budget, your entire newly set budget will be added to your balance.
This prevents you from missing out on your allowance due to the monthly reset (since no allowance would arrive the next day).

2.0) Setting the monthly reserve
--------------------------------------
You can set & adjust your monthly reserve at any time during the month.
The reserve cannot be greater than your budget.
Setting the reserve will adjust the amount of daily allowance you will receive per day - by the end of the month
you will end up with the reserve you set.
If at any point during the month you push your budget below your monthly reserve, your monthly reserve will be reset to 0 and will need to be set again.

3.0) Setting 1 € -> CZK exchange rate
--------------------------------------
If you only use CZK, it’s recommended to not change the exchange rate.
Changing the exchange rate affects your budget in CZK only — your EUR budget remains unchanged.
Refunds are always processed using the original exchange rate from when the transaction was made, so adjusting the rate won’t affect past or refunded transactions, only new ones.
